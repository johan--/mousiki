Hey there! Welcome to **Mousiki**, a terminal music player built from the ground up for people who prefer control, simplicity, and a keyboard.

I created Mousiki because I wanted a fast, focused TUI (Terminal User Interface) without any unnecessary interface layers. It’s designed to be completely keyboard-driven and fully configurable while giving you rich features like spectrum visualizers, synced lyrics, and online streaming—all without ever leaving your terminal.

## ✨ Features

- **Local Music Playback:** Instantly browse and play your local music files.
- **Online Search & Streaming:** Search and stream tracks directly from online sources.
- **Synced Lyrics:** Real-time, word-by-word active lyrics highlighting as the song plays.
- **Visualizers:** Real-time FFT spectrum, waveform rendering, and spinning disk art.
- **Queue Management:** Effortless queueing, shuffling, and repeating.
- **Highly Configurable:** Tweak colors, visualizer fluidity, animations, and hotkeys to match your exact workflow.

## 🚀 Supported Platforms

- **Native Support:** **Linux** and **Android (Termux)**.
- **Unverified Support:** *Windows* and *macOS*. (Support for these platforms is currently not verified because I don't have the hardware access needed to test and debug on those specific operating systems. If you try it out and get it working, feel free to contribute!)

## 🛠️ Getting Started

## Default Keybindings

Keys are currently fixed in the code. The `HKey...` entries in `$HOME/.config/mousiki/config.txt` are not read yet.

### Search & Playback
| Action | Keybinding | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Local Search** | `/` | Filter the local library as you type. `ENTER` keeps the result, `ESC` cancels |
| **Online Stream Search** | `/` then `s: query` | Search and stream music online |
| **Home View** | `ESC` | Back to the full local library, unfiltered |
| **Play** | `ENTER` | Play the selected track |
| **Play / Pause** | `p` | Toggle playback |
| **Next / Previous Track** | `n` / `b` | Play the next or previous row of the current list |
| **Seek** | `ARROW_LEFT` / `ARROW_RIGHT` | Seek 5 seconds backward / forward |
| **Volume** | `1` / `2` | Increase / Decrease volume |
| **Retry Lyrics** | `l` | Fetch lyrics for the current track again |
| **Waveform Style** | `w` | Toggle raw / smooth waveform |

Shuffle, loop, and stop-after-track are set with `PlaybackMode` in settings (`s`).

### Navigation & Queue
| Action | Keybinding | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Navigate** | `ARROW_UP` / `ARROW_DOWN` | Move selection |
| **Sort** | `T` | Cycle folder order / title A-Z / artist A-Z |
| **Switch Focus** | `TAB` | Move focus between the library and the queue |
| **Add to Queue** | `a` | Enqueue selected track |
| **Remove from Queue** | `t` | Remove the selected queue item |
| **Remove Last Queued** | `d` | Remove the last item in the queue |
| **Reorder Queue** | `u` / `ARROW_LEFT` | With the queue focused, move the selected item up / down |
| **Settings** | `s` | Open settings. `TAB` changes panel, `s` saves and closes, `ESC` closes |
| **Redraw** | `r` | Redraw the screen after a resize glitch |
| **Quit** | `q` | Exit application |


### Prerequisites & Installation

Mousiki relies on a few external tools for audio fetching, decoding, and lyrics. The easiest way to get started is by running the setup script on a Debian-based Linux system or Termux:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/itzender5820/mousiki.git
cd mousiki

# Run the setup script (installs dependencies, sets up config, and builds the app)
bash setup.sh
```

If you're building manually, ensure you have `cmake`, a C++17 compiler, `ffmpeg`, `yt-dlp`, and the Python `syncedlyrics` package installed.

### Running the App

After a successful build, you can start the player with:
```bash
./build/mousiki
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Your configuration file will be automatically generated at `$HOME/.config/mousiki/config.txt`. From there, you have complete freedom to customize Mousiki.

### Adding Custom Music Paths
You can easily tell Mousiki where to look for your music. Simply add multiple `LocalMusicPath` entries in your `config.txt`:

```ini
# Add as many custom paths as you need:
LocalMusicPath=/custom/path
LocalMusicPath=/home/user/Music
```

## 🙏 Attribution & Dependencies
